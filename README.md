# Advent of Code 2022
My code for the Advent of Code 2022. (It's pretty bad, so don't look at this for help)

This year, I'm doing a challenge where I switch languages (randomly selected) every once in a while:
- 1: Typescript
- 2-3: Haskell
- 4-6: Scala
- 7-9: Kotlin
- 10-12: Rust
- 13-15: Bash
- 16-18: Swift
- 19-21: BASIC
- 22-24: Objective C
- &#127876;: Holy C

I might not be doing swift lmao
